# Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether an underwater object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** using **sonar signal data** and **machine learning techniques**.  
The model is trained on numerical sonar features and performs binary classification using supervised learning algorithms in Python.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Sonar systems emit sound waves and analyze the reflected signals.  
The reflected signals differ for rocks and metallic mines.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can correctly classify these objects based on sonar signal patterns.
